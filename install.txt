I was testing my application on:
- PHP 5.6.38
- MariaDB 10.1.36
- Apache 2.4.34
- Chrome 69

Installation:

1. Run SQL queris from database.txt. You will get new database 'systems' with tables and sample data.
2. To connect with database change the db.php file in config folder:

a) _dbHost - Host IP where the database is on.
b) _dbUser - User name in database with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE privileges.
c) _dbPass - Password for the above user.

3. Run PHP server started from main folder.
4. Open index.php file in browser using your PHP host IP.
